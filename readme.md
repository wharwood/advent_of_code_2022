# Advent of Code 2022
These are my solutions to the 2022 [Advent of Code](https://www.adventofcode.com) puzzle. I'm doing this in 2025 and, to be truthful, I'm not entirely sure why I chose the 2022 version. In any case, this is some fun for me after I've exhausted the NYT Games for the day and I'm looking for more puzzles to solve. It also shows my general approach to programming problems especially those involving data structures. If you have feedback, feel free to open an issue.
